linear things are easy to understand. there are no surprises or unexpected behaviour. But reallity is never linear. We just use linear approximations to get a grasp on complex problems. If you want to be better than the herd, you better embrace nonlinearity.

Why is reality not linear? Simple examples: is going double the speed on the highway make your car use double the amount of gas? is working out 2 hours instead of 1 make you double that strong? or twice as tired? No.

Same with economics: if 1 bottle of milk cost 1$. How much are 10 bottles? probably 10$. Or 8$ cause its a special offer. Or much more cause the store has only 5 left -> nonlinearity

So why do you use linear approximations? Like SMA (linear average), fixed-dist trailing stops etc.? because they are easy to understand and simple to apply. But guess what: Thats why everybody is doing it, and thats why they rarely work.

Better wrap your head around non linear concepts. They can also be simple, but mostly need more effort to apply them. like trailing only on broken thresholds, using ParabolicTrailings, nonlinear calculation of positionSize...
