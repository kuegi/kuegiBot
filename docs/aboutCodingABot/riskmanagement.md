40% of traders quit after 1 month. Only 7% make it for 5 years. If you manage to survive the first years you probably get successful. It took me 2.5 years. And i made back the losses of 2.5 years in 3 months. How: risk- and Moneymanagement. a thread. 

RM is what makes you survive your drawdowns. If you have no edge yet, it makes you survive the time until you find one. To have meaningful RM, you need numbers: Your max Drawdown, your max loosing streak, your max handleable drop in accountsize.

The last one is really important! You can try to trade a system with inital risk per position of 10%, knowing that your max DD is 30% (cause of high winrate) and make a killing (by not adapting the positition size on every trade).

But in reallity you probably can't really trade it like that. you will start to cut winners short, trail stops to fast cause of to much money on the line making you itchy. in the end you loose money.

Choose your positionsize so that you don't even blink if you lost it. Choose your risk in a way that double your expected max DD won't make you stop trading. In the beginning, RM is about surving the rampup. After that its about staying sane and in the game.
